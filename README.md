## 📌 Overview

This repository documents **core Database Design concepts and practical artifacts** developed as part of a database systems course.  
It focuses on **designing robust, scalable relational databases** using industry-standard principles.

The work demonstrates:
- Translating **business requirements → database schemas**
- Applying **normalization** to reduce redundancy
- Designing **entity-relationship (ER) models**
- Understanding **relational integrity and constraints**

These skills are critical for **Data Engineering, Backend Development, and ML system design**.

# 🧪 Topics Covered (Detailed)

---

## 1️⃣ Database Design Lifecycle

### Concepts Covered
- Requirement analysis
- Conceptual design
- Logical design
- Physical design


“How do you go from requirements to a database schema?”

---

## 2️⃣ Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling

### Concepts Covered
- Entities and attributes
- Primary keys
- Relationships (1–1, 1–M, M–M)
- Weak entities
- Cardinality and participation constraints

---

## 3️⃣ Normalization

### Concepts Covered
- First Normal Form (1NF)
- Second Normal Form (2NF)
- Third Normal Form (3NF)
- Functional dependencies
- Eliminating redundancy and update anomalies


“Why is normalization important?”

---

## 4️⃣ Relational Schema Design

### Concepts Covered
- Mapping ER diagrams to relational tables
- Primary keys and foreign keys
- Referential integrity
- Constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK)

---

## 5️⃣ Database Integrity & Constraints

### Concepts Covered
- Entity integrity
- Referential integrity
- Domain constraints
- Cascading updates and deletes

---

## 6️⃣ Design Trade-offs & Denormalization (Conceptual)

### Concepts Covered
- When denormalization is appropriate
- Read vs write performance trade-offs
- Practical considerations in real-world systems

## 🧠 How This Fits Into My Portfolio

Database design knowledge supports my work in:
- SQL and data analytics
- Data engineering pipelines
- Backend API development
- Machine learning feature storage
- Scalable AI system architectures

It enables me to design **clean, maintainable, and scalable data models**.

---

## ⚙️ How to Use This Repository

- Review the PDF notes for theoretical understanding
- Study ER diagrams to understand modeling decisions
- Apply concepts when designing schemas in SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)

---

## 🧾 Points 

- Designed **relational database schemas** by translating business requirements into **ER models and normalized table structures**.  
- Applied **normalization principles (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)** to reduce redundancy and maintain data integrity.  
- Defined **primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints** to enforce referential and domain integrity.  
- Built strong database design foundations supporting **data engineering, backend development, and machine learning systems**.

---

## 🧠 I Points

- “I follow a structured database design lifecycle.”
- “I can explain normalization with real examples.”
- “I understand trade-offs between normalization and performance.”
